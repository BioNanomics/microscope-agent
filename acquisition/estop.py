# Emergency stop for every process that can move this microscope.
#
#   python -m acquisition.estop engage        # STOP EVERYTHING, NOW
#   python -m acquisition.estop status
#   python -m acquisition.estop release       # deliberate, separate action
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-09-21 a mosaic raster with a bad focus plane
# began driving Z toward the sample. Stopping it took several minutes and
# three separate interventions, because every mechanism available was the
# wrong shape:
#
#   * stopping the background SHELL left its python CHILD running, still
#     issuing moves - the process list, not the task list, was the truth
#   * a tool call the operator REJECTED had already spawned its process,
#     which kept looping Z moves regardless of the rejection
#   * a "STOP file" checked once per mosaic tile is not a stop; between
#     checks it still issued dozens of moves
#   * the Ti2 SDK has NO abort/halt command (searched: only ZESCAPE, which
#     is a retract, not a stop), so there is nothing to "cancel" with
#
# The lesson is that an e-stop must sit BELOW whatever is misbehaving. So
# this is enforced inside nis_sdk's move primitives themselves: no caller,
# no matter how confused, can move an axis while the stop is engaged,
# because the check happens after the caller has already decided to move.
#
# WHY A FILE. It must work across processes that do not know about each
# other - that was the whole failure. A file is visible to every process,
# survives the death of whoever set it, needs no server or port, and can
# be set by a human from any shell (or by creating the file by hand) when
# the agent itself is the thing malfunctioning.
#
# WHY A FIXED PATH, NOT data_root(). data_root() resolves relative to the
# working directory, and an MCP server launched by a desktop client gets a
# different cwd than a terminal. Two processes would then disagree about
# where the e-stop lives, which is precisely the failure this must not
# have. ESTOP_PATH is absolute and identical for every process on the
# machine.
#
# FAIL SAFE: if the state cannot be determined (unreadable directory, odd
# filesystem error), check() treats the stop as ENGAGED. An e-stop that
# fails open is not a safety device. The cost of the opposite error is a
# refused move and a clear message, which is recoverable; the cost of
# failing open is a driven objective.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT DO: it cannot stop a move the controller has already
# accepted. A move in flight runs to its end; the stop takes effect at the
# next move. move_xy splits long moves into HOP_UM hops, so an XY move
# stops within one hop (measured: 0.54 s, <= 4 mm).
#
# WHY NO HALT. engage() used to also write the current position back as
# the target, to freeze an axis mid-travel. estop_inflight_test showed
# that is worse than nothing: position reads are cached for the whole move
# (XY and Z), so the "current" position is the START, and the write queues
# behind the move. A 1 mm Z move ran to its end, then the halt drove Z all
# the way back - a second move, issued by the stop. Never add it back.
