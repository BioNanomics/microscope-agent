# nis_events.py
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# The NIS event log: one JSON line per thing done through the NIS bridge,
# appended to logs/nis/events-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl. Whoever drives the bridge
# (the NIS MCP server, a script, the command line) writes here, and
# acquisition/nis_monitor.py tails the file, so the monitor shows what
# Claude is doing from another process.
#
# One action is logged as a "start" line, then one closing line: "ok", or
# "failed" (the bridge refused it or NIS reported an error), "refused" (the
# client's e-stop check stopped it before anything was sent) or "error"
# (the bridge was not reachable). The start line is what lets the monitor
# say "nd_run has been running for 42 s" while the bridge is busy.
#
# Logging must never get in the way of the microscope, so a failed write
# is swallowed.
